To use this project follow the steps below\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone the repository to your computer.
\item Open the project directory in an IDE (preferably CLion because our project uses CMake).
\item Run the program simply by clicking the button \textquotesingle{}Run\textquotesingle{} on the top of the screen (CLion).
\item Select the input file you want to use. The data files must be \textquotesingle{}.csv\textquotesingle{}. The format of the files should be the following\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item For the stations file, the data should be in this order\+: Name,District,Municipality,Township,Line.
\item For the network file, the data should be in this order\+: Station\+\_\+A,Station\+\_\+B,Capacity,Service.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Every input (except the files) must be in Camel\+Case (ex. Lisboa\+Oriente).
\item If you\textquotesingle{}re using Windows operating system, you may run into some problems with some characters like \textquotesingle{}à\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}ç\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}ã\textquotesingle{}. In that case consider using files that don\textquotesingle{}t have those types of characters.

In the main menu there are 10 options, one of them being the exit option. The other 9, in the respective order, do the following\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Displays every station\textquotesingle{}s name, district and line.
\item Displays all the information of a chosen station, including its connections.
\item Calculates the maximum number of trains that can simultaneously travel between two stations (Max Flow).
\item Calculates the pairs that require the most amount of trains (Max Flow).
\item Calculates the transportation needs of each municipality and district and displays the top-\/k.
\item Calculates the maximum number of trains that can simultaneously arrive at a station (Max Flow).
\item Calculates the maximum amount of trains that can simultaneously travel through the minimum cost path between two stations (Min Cost).
\item Calculates the maximum number of trains that can simultaneously travel between two stations with just 1 type of service (Max Flow).
\item Calculates the difference in every station\textquotesingle{}s maximum number of trains that can simultaneously arrive at it after blocking one connection (Max Flow).
